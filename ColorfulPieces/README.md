# ColorfulPieces

  * You can color any building piece that can be built using the Hammer using RGB or HTML color codes.
    * Coloring is very simple at the moment and will color all materials/textures on the object (to be refined later).
    * Those without the mod installed will still see the default vanilla materials/textures.

# Instructions

  1. Unzip `ColorfulPieces.dll` to your `/Valheim/BepInEx/plugins/` folder.
  2. In-game, press F1 to bring up the ConfigurationManager and navigate to the ColorfulPieces section.
     * Change the target color using the RGB sliders or using an HTML color code.
     * Change the target emission color factor using the slider (this affects how bright the target color will be).
  3. Hover over any building piece ***that you are the owner of*** and a prompt will appear.
     * Hit `LeftShift + R` to change the building piece color to the target color and emission factor.
     * Hit `LeftAlt + R` to clear any existing colors from the building piece.
