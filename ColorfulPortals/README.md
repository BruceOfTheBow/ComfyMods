# ColorfulLights

  * You can color the activation glow effect of any portal using RGB and HTML color codes!
  * Those without the mod will still see the vanilla yellow/red glow effect.
  * ***Stone portals*** prefabs are fixed to work (though cannot be built and requires serverside mod to connect).

# Instructions

  1. Unzip `ColorfulPortals.dll` to your `/Valheim/BepInEx/plugins/` folder.
  2. In-game, press F1 to bring up the ConfigurationManager and navigate to the ColorfulPortals section.
     * Change the target color using the RGB sliders or using an HTML color code.
  3. Hover over any portal ***that you are the owner of*** and a prompt to change its color will appear.
  4. Hit `LeftShift + E` to change the color.
