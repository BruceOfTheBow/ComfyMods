This mod is used for the [Comfy Valheim](https://discord.gg/ameHJz5PFk) server to make installing mods faster.

It does not include all of our allowed mods, just the ones I thought most people would use. See the full allowed list in the #allowed-mods channel.

Mostly this is just a list of mods and it tells the mod manager other mods to install (dependencies). However, a few mods have been repacked into this one for ease of setup and customizing for our server.

List is managed by the Comfy Dev team. If you need help feel free to reach out to me on the [Comfy Valheim Discord](https://discord.gg/ameHJz5PFk).
